Super Store Sales Analysis Dashboard ðŸ“Šâœ¨
Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Super Store dataset, offering deep insights into sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior. The primary objective is to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence that can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. The dashboard aims to identify key trends, pinpoint areas of high and low performance, and understand regional and product-specific sales dynamics.

Tools & Technologies
Microsoft Power BI Desktop: Used for data ingestion, transformation, modeling, and visualization.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for creating custom measures and calculated columns to derive key performance indicators (KPIs).

Power Query: Employed for data cleaning, shaping, and preparation.

Key KPIs
The dashboard focuses on the following key performance indicators to track business performance:

Total Sales: The overall revenue generated.

Total Orders: The number of transactions completed.

Average Profit: The average profit per order.

Total Quantity: The total number of items sold.

Dashboard Features
The interactive dashboard includes several features to facilitate in-depth analysis:

Regional Insights: Users can filter data by region (Central, East, South, West) to analyze performance across different geographical areas.

Sales Trends: A line chart displays the Sum of Sales by Month to show seasonal patterns and trends over time.

Product Performance: A bar chart visualizes the Sum of Sales by Sub-Category, highlighting top-selling and underperforming product categories.

Customer Segmentation: The data can be analyzed by Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments to understand sales and profit distribution across different customer types.

Discount Analysis: The dataset can be further explored to understand the impact of discounts on sales and profitability.

Methodology
Data Preparation: The raw sales data was loaded into Power BI, and Power Query was used to clean and transform the data, ensuring it was ready for analysis. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and splitting columns as needed.

Data Modeling: Relationships were established between different tables (if any) to create a robust data model. Key measures were created using DAX to calculate important metrics like total sales, average profit, and total quantity.

Data Visualization: A set of interactive visuals was designed to represent the data in a clear and intuitive manner, enabling users to explore insights easily.

Types of Visuals Used
The dashboard incorporates a variety of visuals to present the data effectively:

KPI Cards: Used to display high-level metrics like Total Orders, Average Profit, Total Sales, and Total Quantity.

Line Chart: Displays the Sum of Sales by Month to show trends over time.

Bar Chart: Highlights the Sum of Sales by Sub-Category to compare product performance.

Map: A geographical map visualizes sales and profit distribution across the different regions.

Donut Chart: Shows the Sum of Sales, max and Target, providing a quick overview of sales performance against a set target.

Table/Matrix: Provides detailed, tabular data views for specific analysis.
